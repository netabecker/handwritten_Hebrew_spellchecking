# **handwritten Hebrew spellchecking Model**


### Breakdown to tasks:

1. **OCR Model:** \
Use the existing OCR model to extract the sentences form a written paragraph.

2. **Create a dataset of misspelled sentences:** \
Create a dataset of misspelled sentences and their correct versio

3. **Error Detection and Correction Model** \
Error Detection: Develop a model to identify potential spelling errors in the OCR output.
Correction Suggestions: Train a model (seq2seq or transformers) to suggest corrections for the identified errors.

4. **Training the Spellchecking Model** \
Training Data: Create pairs of erroneous text and the corresponding correct text. \
Model Architecture: Look at models like BERT or GPT.

5. **Evaluation and Fine-Tuning** \
Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of your spellchecker.
Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune your model on a validation set and iteratively improve its performance.

6. **Integration and Testing** \
Integration: Integrate your spellchecker with the OCR model to form a complete pipeline from handwritten text image to corrected digital text.
Testing: Test the entire pipeline on new handwritten Hebrew text samples.

**Tools and Libraries** \
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch \
NLP Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, NLTK, SpaCy \
Data Augmentation: Tools for generating synthetic handwritten text images (if needed) 


### Example Workflow

```
ocr_output = ocr_model.predict(handwritten_text_image)
Spellchecking Model:

corrected_text = spellchecker_model.correct(ocr_output)
End-to-End Pipeline:

def process_image(image):
    ocr_output = ocr_model.predict(image)
    corrected_text = spellchecker_model.correct(ocr_output)
    return corrected_text
```
